# E-Commerce
This is the backend of an E-commerce application, built using Spring Boot and MySQL. It provides RESTful APIs for user authentication, product management, order handling, and more. The project is designed to serve as a complete backend solution for a typical e-commerce platform, with JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.
